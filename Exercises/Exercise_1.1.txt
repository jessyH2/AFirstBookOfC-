2. Practice
	a.) Fix a flat tire
		a.0.) Get a jack
		a.1.) Get a lever
		a.2.) Place the lever correctly on the tube that is made for it, present in the jack
		a.3.) Push and Pull the lever that you put in the jack until the tire is elevated from the 			ground
		a.4.) Lock the jack in place
		a.5.) Get a wrench, fit to the size of the nuts that is used to fasten the wheel
		a.6.) Put the head of the wrench (where it fits the nut) into the nut
		a.7.) Rotate the wrench counter-clockwise to its current position to remove the nut
		a.8.) Do this to all the remaining nuts in the same wheel that has a flat tire
		a.9.) Remove the wheel
		a.10.) Get two tire wrench
		a.11.) Put both of the tire wrench on the lowest side of the tire, relative to the rim and side			by side with a distance of 3 inches from each other
		a.12.) Push the tire wrench down to position part of the tire above the rim
		a.13.) Leave one tire wrench in the same position while repeat step a.11(using one wrench only) 		and step a.12 until you remove half of the tire from the rim.
		a.14.) Remove the interior tube from the tire
		a.15.) Get a new interior tube
		a.16.) Replace the old interior tube
		a.17.) ...

3. Practice. Assume there are two cups of water and another empty cup, swap them. Let's name the cups A, B, and C.
	0.) Pour the contents of Cup A to Cup C
	1.) Wash Cup A
	2.) Pour the contents of Cup B to Cup A
	3.) Wash Cup B
	4.) Pour the contents of Cub C to Cup B
	5.) Wash Cup C
	6.) And you're done
